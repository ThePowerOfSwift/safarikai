# Safarikai

Translate Japanese words on web pages. Inspired by rikaichan and rikaikun, with love for Safari.

# How to Use

* Download and install [Safarikai.safariextz](http://bit.ly/safarikai-dl)
* Enable translating by clicking the Safarikai toggle button on Safari toolbar
* Hover over Japanese word; if Safarikai finds translation(s) for that word a popup will show

Safarikai has > 20MB dictionary data files and it usually takes 5~20 seconds for it to load these files and be ready to search Japanese words. By default translating is disabled to make little impact on your browsing experience.

This means every time Safari is relaunched, you have to enable translating manually.

## Special Thanks

* [yaku](https://code.google.com/p/yaku/): A project from [Bryan McKelvey](http://www.brymck.com/) which has dict data as JavaScript files. I took them with some modifications.
* [Rikaichan](http://www.polarcloud.com/rikaichan/): A popup Japanese-English/German/French/Russian dictionary tool for Firefox, Thunderbird and Seamonkey.
* [rikaikun](https://code.google.com/p/rikaikun): A port of rikaichan for chrome. Translate Japanese by hovering over words.
